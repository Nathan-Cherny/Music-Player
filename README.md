# Music-Player
I got fed up using YouTube as a music player so I decided to make one for myself.

Some features:

- assures that only one song is playing at a time, with identifiers like changing the <title> of the page to the song
- "clipping" where you can highlight a certain great part of a song and put it into its own "clip" section
- auto play, where on ending a song it will progress to the next one in line. can also press "l" to disable this and have every song loop.
- youtube-dl implemented in the page for easy downloading songs
- slow down or speed up a song
- multiple playlists that you can create or delete on the spot
- json file that records how many times you've played a song and 'bookmarks'
- press . when playing a song to place a 'bookmark.' at the part of the song that you placed a bookmark you can press the number associated with that bookmark (ex: your first bookmark is 1, second is 2, etc.) and you'll skip to that point in the song.
- lots of shortcuts like looping, going to beginning of the song, play next song etc
